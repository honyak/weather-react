# Weather-React App
I created this project after a review.

## Need to add:
Error handling (if zip code doesn't exist)
Some way to get data per day, or choose/filter 12:00 noon each day and display those stats.
Some indication of loading: Loading gif or wait to display the current location
Better formatting, need to justify results in line
Better UI than Accordion. It is cumbersome to open them.
