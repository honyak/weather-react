#Weather Pro app

##Summary
Weather Pro takes a user location input and gives the weather temperature and condition in 3 hour intervals. This is a project I developed myself to practice using the OpenWeather API with React. I utilize a Class Component with state management to store user input location, and API responses.

##Technologies
###React.js, Node.js, MaterialUI, Google geolocation API, OpenWeather API
